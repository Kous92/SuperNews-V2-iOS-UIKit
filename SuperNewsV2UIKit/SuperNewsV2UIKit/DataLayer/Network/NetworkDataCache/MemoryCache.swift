 Manages the cache in memory of any data type to prevent downloading same data more than one time. Also, with an `actor` (reference type), it's used to be safe in concurrent environments, meaning with multiple threads (here from `Task` blocks and `async` functions), to prevent data races (unpredictable behaviors, memory corruption, crashes) thanks to a dedicated synchronized access to its isolated data). The data will be accessed with `await` into `async` functions.
    
 Also, this cache manager has an expiration date to make sure when the time interval is expired, to allow the app downloading new data.
